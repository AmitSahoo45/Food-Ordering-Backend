#Project Objective

● Restaurants or street vendors can register themselves on this app. Create menus and set their prices.
● Customers can create an account and place orders on the app.
● Users can order food from restaurants. This order history should be visible for both restaurants and users.
● At a time a restaurant should not accept more than 10 live orders.
● Submission with documentation will be given preference.
● You take zomato or swiggy as reference.

## Regarding the controllers 
**Within the controllers folder there is a readme.md file that provides documentation to all the controllers**

## Regarding the models
**Within the models folder there is a readme.md file that provides documentation to all the models**

## Regarding the Routes
**Within the routes folder there is a readme.md file that provides documentation to all the routes**


---
> Although there is no need to provide an explanation or documentation to the routes and models as they are self explainatory and can be easily understood by a good programmer.
> ONLY DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED TO THE CONTROLLERS, **whose readme.md is provided in the controller's folder itself**.
